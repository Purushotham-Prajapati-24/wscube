This is a page which i made by copying the figma style by a source.
I used HTML,CSS and bootstrap to make this page. Its is just a dummy page made just to test how good bootstrap can be used in making front end of pages. 
The best thing is the page is responsive on both large screen as well as mobile screen and adjust lot other features by itself without using any external JS file. This is the power of Bootstrap.

Bootstrap a css framework. Its is can be used when a user add its cdn link in html by using LINK tag similar to linking external css file to html.. 
This project is not yet completed. Will try to complete its front end soon. Learning Web development with bootstrap is like using cheat codes in GTA sanandreas Game. I loved it and eagerly waiting to know its limitations so that i can use it at its maximum potential. Will keep on adding necessary updates. Thank You for reading this till here
